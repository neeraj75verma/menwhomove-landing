        You didn’t just fill a form — you stepped into a movement.  
        A shift in how men show up, focus, and rise.  
        What’s coming isn’t just a product drop — it’s a trigger.  
        A signal for those who are done waiting, and ready to move.  
        The drop is being prepared. The fire is building.  
        Until then... we wait — together.
